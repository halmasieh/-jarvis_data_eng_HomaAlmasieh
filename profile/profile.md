## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HomaAlmasieh](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HomaAlmasieh)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HomaAlmasieh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Monitoring Agent on a node/server within the linux cluster to collect the hardware specifications and monitor the cluster node resource usage in real time. This Monitoring Agent contains a PostgreSQL server installed within a Docker container that collects information submitted through bash scripts installed on each node.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HomaAlmasieh/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - Grep App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.

## Highlighted Projects
**Spotify Analysis** [[GitHub](https://github.com/halmasieh/Spotify_Analysis)]: Colaborated in a team of five to determine what features impact the Popularity index of any given song on Spotify using Python. Analyzed various physical features of a song as well as some peripheral features to identify a pattern within how a song garners a successful Popularity index. Created a machine learning model that can predict the popularity of a song based on these features and utilized Tableau to visualize the outcomes and discuss the findings.
 **Key Tech**: Web Scaping, Pandas, SKLearn, Tableau

**Credit Risk Analysis** [[GitHub](https://github.com/halmasieh/Credit_Risk_Analysis)]: Used the credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. Oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Used a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Compared two new machine learning models BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier that reduce bias. Lastly, evaluated the performance of these models to be used to predict credit risk. **Key Tech**: Jupyter Notebook and Scikit-Learn

**Amazon_Vine_Analysis** [[GitHub](https://github.com/halmasieh/Amazon_Vine_Analysis)]:  Created an AWS RDS database with tables in pgAdmin. Picked a dataset from the Amazon Review datasets and extracted it. Determined bias of vine reviews. **Key Tech**: PySpark, SQL, Cloud Service (AWS)
