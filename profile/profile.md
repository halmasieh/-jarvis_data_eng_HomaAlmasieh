# Homa Almasieh . Jarvis Consulting

 I recently completed Data Analytics BootCamp from University of Toronto focused on gainnig technical programming skills in Excel, VBA, Python, R, JavaScript, SQL Databases, Tableau, Big Data, and Machine Learning. I worked with various datasets during the BootCamp program and according to the content of the projects, I used various tools to analyze the data, design the model and visualize the finding through Tableau and dashboards. In addition, I am a former Assistant Professor of University in the area of Applied Mathematics with a brilliant and valuable background in the field of teaching and scientific research. With this extensive background of Mathematics and Data, I started  my training program at Jarvis with developing various projects and this mentorship helped me to gain skills in increasing code efficiency, debugging and gaining comprehensive knowledge in Linux/Bash, Git, Java, Docker, RDBMS and Springboot. I am a self-initiated and avid learner with highly attentive to details, critical thinking and logical problem solving. My adaptability allows me to work in many different environments, in addition to speaking with people from various backgrounds. I am looking forward to speaking about my academic and professional background for developing positions mainly in the data  analytics field.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HomaAlmasieh](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HomaAlmasieh)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HomaAlmasieh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Monitoring Agent on a node/server within the linux cluster to collect the hardware specifications and monitor the cluster node resource usage in real time. This Monitoring Agent contains a PostgreSQL server installed within a Docker container that collects information submitted through bash scripts installed on each node.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HomaAlmasieh/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Built an application that would use Twitter's REST APIs to provide services to the end-user, such as being able to add, show, or delete Tweets. Java was used to implement all the components, and Spring Boot was used to manage all of the dependencies. JUnit and Mockito were used to test the application, and Maven was used to package it. Deployment was done using Docker.
  - JDBC App: Created an application that would access a database and perform queries using JDBC. Java and JDBC APIs were used to create the DAO necessary to perform operations with a Postgres database running on Docker, and to segregate these procedures from business side logic.
  - Grep App: Constructed a replica of the grep command line utility. Used Java along with Lambda and Stream APIs as part of the implementation, and used Maven to package the application, which was later deployed on Docker Hub using Docker.

**Cloud/DevOps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HomaAlmasieh/tree/master/cloud_devops)]: Not Started


## Highlighted Projects
**Spotify Analysis** [[GitHub](https://github.com/halmasieh/Spotify_Analysis)]: Colaborated in a team of five to determine what features impact the Popularity index of any given song on Spotify using Python. Analyzed various physical features of a song as well as some peripheral features to identify a pattern within how a song garners a successful Popularity index. Created a machine learning model that can predict the popularity of a song based on these features and utilized Tableau to visualize the outcomes and discuss the findings.
 **Key Tech**: Web Scaping, Pandas, SKLearn, Tableau

**Credit Risk Analysis** [[GitHub](https://github.com/halmasieh/Credit_Risk_Analysis)]: Used the credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. Oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Used a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Compared two new machine learning models BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier that reduce bias. Lastly, evaluated the performance of these models to be used to predict credit risk. **Key Tech**: Jupyter Notebook and Scikit-Learn

**Amazon_Vine_Analysis** [[GitHub](https://github.com/halmasieh/Amazon_Vine_Analysis)]:  Created an AWS RDS database with tables in pgAdmin. Picked a dataset from the Amazon Review datasets and extracted it. Determined bias of vine reviews. **Key Tech**: PySpark, SQL, Cloud Service (AWS)
