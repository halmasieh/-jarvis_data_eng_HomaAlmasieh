# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: " I recently completed Data Analytics BootCamp from the University of Toronto focused on gaining technical
programming skills in Excel, VBA, Python, R, JavaScript, SQL Databases, Tableau, Big Data,
and Machine Learning. I worked with various datasets during the BootCamp program and according to
the content of the projects, I used various tools to analyze the data, design the model and
visualize the finding through Tableau and dashboards. In addition, I am a former Assistant
Professor of University in the area of Applied Mathematics with a brilliant and valuable background
in the field of teaching and scientific research. With this extensive background in
Mathematics and Data, I started my training program at Jarvis by developing various projects.
This mentorship helped me increase code efficiency, debugging and gain comprehensive knowledge
in Linux/Bash, Git, and Java Docker, RDBMS and Springboot. I am a self-initiated and avid
learner with great attention to detail, critical thinking and logical problem-solving. My
adaptability allows me to work in many different environments and speak with people from various backgrounds."

    description: "Implemented a Monitoring Agent on a node/server that collects the hardware specifications and monitors
    the cluster node resource usage in real-time within the Linux cluster running on CentOS 7. The collected data include the host's
    CPU number, total memory, memory free, disk I/O, etc., which are stored in an RDBMS database. This Monitoring Agent contains a PostgreSQL
    server installed within a Docker container that collects information every minute using bash scripts and crontab installed on each node."

    description:
      #keywords: Java 8, REST API, OAuth, Design patterns (e.g. DAO, MVC), JUnit, Mockito, Docker
      - "Twitter CRUD App: Built an application that would use Twitter's REST APIs to provide services to the end-user, such
      as being able to add, show, or delete Tweets. Java was used to implement all the components, and Springboot
      managed all of the dependencies. JUnit and Mockito were used to test the application, and Maven was used for packaging it. Deployment
      was done using Docker."
      #keywords: Java 8, JDBC, RDBMS, SQL, CRUD, DAO
      - "JDBC App: Created an application that would access a database and perform queries using JDBC. Java and JDBC APIs were used
      to create the DAO necessary to perform operations with a Postgres database running on Docker and segregate these procedures from business-side logic."
      #keywords: Java 8 Lambda, Stream API, IntelliJ IDEA
      - "Grep App: Constructed a replica of the grep command-line utility. Used Java along with Lambda and Stream APIs as part of
      the implementation and utilized Maven to package the application, which was later deployed on Docker Hub using Docker."

    description: "Performed data analysis for transaction data reported from LGS to help the marketing team to answer the business questions in order to increase the company's revenue using RFM report.
    The analysis were conducted using a Jupyter notebook, and Python was used along with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numPy, scipy, seaborn and SQLAlchemy.
    Docker was used to run the Postgres container, which is the company's data warehouse."

    git_url: "https://github.com/halmasieh/Spotify_Analysis"
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Collaborated in a team of five to determine what features impact the Popularity index of any given song on Spotify using Python. Analyzed various physical features of a song as well as some peripheral features to identify a pattern within how a song garners a successful Popularity index. Created a machine learning model that can predict the popularity of a song based on these features and utilized Tableau to visualize the outcomes and discuss the findings.\n
    **Key Tech**: Web Scaping, Pandas, SKLearn, Tableau"
  - name: "Credit Risk Analysis"
    git_url: "https://github.com/halmasieh/Credit_Risk_Analysis"
    description: "Used the credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. Oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Used a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Compared two new machine learning models BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier that reduce bias. Lastly, evaluated the performance of these models to be used to predict credit risk.
    **Key Tech**: Jupyter Notebook and Scikit-Learn"
