# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: " I recently completed Data Analytics BootCamp from the University of Toronto focused on gaining technical programming skills in Excel, VBA, Python, R, JavaScript, SQL Databases, Tableau, Big Data, and Machine Learning.
I worked with various datasets during the BootCamp program and according to the content of the projects, I used various tools to analyze the data, design the model and visualize the finding through Tableau and dashboards.
In addition, I am a former Assistant Professor of University in the area of Applied Mathematics with a brilliant and valuable background in the field of teaching and scientific research.
With this extensive background of Mathematics and Data, I started  my training program at Jarvis by developing various projects and this mentorship helped me to gain skills in increasing code efficiency, debugging, and
gaining comprehensive knowledge in Linux/Bash, Git, Java, Docker, RDBMS and Springboot. I am a self-initiated and avid learner with high attention to detail, critical thinking and logical problem-solving.
My adaptability allows me to work in many different environments, in addition to speaking with people from various backgrounds. I am looking forward to speaking about my academic and professional background for
developing positions mainly in the data analytics field."

    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    #keywords: CentOS, Bash/Shell, Docker, RDBMS/SQL/Postgresql, Crontab, Data Analytics
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).

    description: "Implemented a Monitoring Agent on a node/server that collects the hardware specifications and monitors the cluster node resource usage in real-time
    within the Linux cluster running on CentOS 7. The collected data include the host's CPU number, total memory, memory free, disk I/O, etc which are stored in a RDBMS database.
    This Monitoring Agent contains a PostgreSQL server installed within a Docker container that collects information every minute using bash scripts and crontab installed on each node."

    description:
      #keywords: Java 8, REST API, OAuth, Design patterns (e.g. DAO, MVC), JUnit, Mockito, Docker
      - "Twitter CRUD App: Built an application that would use Twitter's REST APIs to provide services to the end-user, such as being able to add, show, or delete Tweets. Java was used to implement all the components, and Springboot was used to managing all of the dependencies. JUnit and Mockito were used to test the application, and Maven was used to package it. Deployment was done using Docker."
      #keywords: Java 8, JDBC, RDBMS, SQL, CRUD, DAO
      - "JDBC App: Created an application that would access a database and perform queries using JDBC. Java and JDBC APIs were used to create the DAO necessary to perform operations with a Postgres database running on Docker, and to segregate these procedures from business side logic."
      #keywords: Java 8 Lambda, Stream API, IntelliJ IDEA
      - "Grep App: Constructed a replica of the grep command-line utility. Used Java along with Lambda and Stream APIs as part of the implementation, and used Maven to package the application, which was later deployed on Docker Hub using Docker."

    git_url: "https://github.com/halmasieh/Spotify_Analysis"
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Collaborated in a team of five to determine what features impact the Popularity index of any given song on Spotify using Python. Analyzed various physical features of a song as well as some peripheral features to identify a pattern within how a song garners a successful Popularity index. Created a machine learning model that can predict the popularity of a song based on these features and utilized Tableau to visualize the outcomes and discuss the findings.\n
    **Key Tech**: Web Scaping, Pandas, SKLearn, Tableau"
  - name: "Credit Risk Analysis"
    git_url: "https://github.com/halmasieh/Credit_Risk_Analysis"
    description: "Used the credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. Oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Used a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Compared two new machine learning models BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier that reduce bias. Lastly, evaluated the performance of these models to be used to predict credit risk.
    **Key Tech**: Jupyter Notebook and Scikit-Learn"
