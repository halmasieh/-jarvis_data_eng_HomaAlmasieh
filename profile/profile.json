Analyzed various physical features of a song as well as some peripheral features to identify a pattern within how a song garners a successful Popularity index. Created a machine learning model that can predict the popularity of a song based on these features and utilized Tableau to visualize the outcomes and discuss the findings.\n **Key Tech**: Web Scaping, Pandas, SKLearn, Tableau",

Oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Used a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Compared two new machine learning models BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier that reduce bias. Lastly, evaluated the performance of these models to be used to predict credit risk. **Key Tech**: Jupyter Notebook and Scikit-Learn",

  "summary": " I recently completed Data Analytics BootCamp from the University of Toronto focused on gaining technical programming skills in Excel, VBA, Python, R, JavaScript, SQL Databases, Tableau, Big Data, and Machine Learning. I worked with various datasets during the BootCamp program and according to the content of the projects, I used various tools to analyze the data, design the model and visualize the finding through Tableau and dashboards. In addition, I am a former Assistant Professor of University in the area of Applied Mathematics with a brilliant and valuable background in the field of teaching and scientific research. With this extensive background of Mathematics and Data, I started  my training program at Jarvis by developing various projects and this mentorship helped me to gain skills in increasing code efficiency, debugging, and gaining comprehensive knowledge in Linux/Bash, Git, Java, Docker, RDBMS and Springboot. I am a self-initiated and avid learner with high attention to detail, critical thinking and logical problem-solving. My adaptability allows me to work in many different environments, in addition to speaking with people from various backgrounds. I am looking forward to speaking about my academic and professional background for developing positions mainly in the data analytics field."
