By analyzing various physical features of a song as well as some peripheral features, we look to identify a pattern within how a song garners a successful Popularity index. We have created a machine learning model that can predict the popularity of a song based on these features and have utilized Tableau to visualize the outcomes and discuss the findings \n key Tech: Web Scaping, Pandas, SKLearn, Tableau",

Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I compared two new machine learning models BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier that reduce bias. Lastly, I evaluated the performance of these models to be used to predict credit risk.",
